Data structure is a way of storing and organising the data so that it can be accessed effectively. Linked List is a linear data structure made up of chain of nodes in which each node contains a data field and link or reference.


A)traversal method:-
1)start with the hrad of the linked list,access the data if head is not null
2)go to next node access node data
3)continue untill last node
Code:-
class Node:
    def __init__(self,data):
        self.data = data
        self.nref = None
        self.pref=None
        

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def print_LL(self):
        if self.head is None:
            print("Linked list is empty!")
        else:
            n = self.head
            while n is not None:
                print(n.data)
                n = n.ref

l=LinkedList()
l.print_LL()
